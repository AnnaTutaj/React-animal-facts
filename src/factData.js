      "The charismatic otter, a member of the weasel family, is found on every continent except Australia and Antarctica. Most are small, with short ears and noses, elongated bodies, long tails, and soft, dense fur. There are 13 species in total, ranging from the small-clawed otter to the giant otter. Though most live in freshwater rivers, lakes, and wetlands, the sea otter and the smaller marine otter are found in the Pacific Ocean."

      "Wild boar is a close relative of domestic pig. There are four subspecies of wild boar that are similar in size and appearance, but differ in color (which depends on the type of habitat). Native populations of wild boars can be found in Africa, Europe and Asia (Japan, Indonesia, India and the Far East). Wild boars can survive in different types of habitat: grasslands, taiga, tropical rainforests, but they prefer life in deciduous forests. Wild boars are threatened by habitat loss and by commercial hunt. Luckily, wild populations are still stable and they are not listed as endangered species."
